    <p>
        Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter.
        It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.
    </p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>
        The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements.
        Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as <bdi>Fe</bdi> for iron, <bdi>H</bdi> for hydrogen, and <bdi>O</bdi> for oxygen.
        Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>

    <p>
        Chemical reactions are represented using <cite>chemical equations</cite>.
        Here's an example of a <dfn>chemical reaction</dfn>:
    </p>
    <p>
        <samp>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> â†’ 2H<sub>2</sub>O</samp>
    </p>
    <p>
        This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<var>H<sub>2</sub></var>) and oxygen gas (<var>O<sub>2</sub></var>) to form water (<var>H<sub>2</sub>O</var>).
    </p>

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>
        <kbd>Stoichiometry</kbd> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions.
        It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
    </p>

    <p>
        <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.
    </p>

    <h5>Conclusion</h5>

    <p>
        Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us.
        From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
